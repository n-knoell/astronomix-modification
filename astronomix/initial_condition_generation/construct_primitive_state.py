Assemble the primitive state array from individual primitive fields.

Given the per-variable fields (density, velocities, magnetic field components,
pressures, ...) this stacks them into the single state array used throughout
the solver, placing each field at the index dictated by ``registered_variables``
for the active configuration (dimensionality, MHD, solver mode, equation of
state).

    Thin wrapper around the jitted :func:`_assemble_primitive_state` that adds a

    always means a bad initial condition (a divide-by-zero, an out-of-range log,

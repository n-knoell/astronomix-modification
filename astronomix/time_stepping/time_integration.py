"""
Time integration of the fluid equations.

This module wires together everything needed to advance a primitive state in
time: it prepares the helper data and sharding, optionally compiles for memory
analysis or runtime debugging, and then drives the per-step update through the
generic loop driver (fixed-step / adaptive while / checkpointed). The snapshot
machinery that records diagnostics along the way also lives here. For the
available options see the simulation configuration and the simulation parameters.

    - The solver going unstable and producing NaNs (caught by ``checkify`` when
      ``runtime_debugging`` is on). We suggest the stability knobs: positivity
      protection, a positivity-preserving limiter, and a smaller CFL number.

    :func:`_run_segment`; afterwards the loop carry (primitive state, PRNG key,

    written to ``config.snapshot_storage_path`` via Orbax. The carry stays on device

    independently, so this scales to multiple devices / nodes.

    Returns the final (unpadded) primitive state, like the no-snapshot path of
    :func:`_time_integration`; the per-snapshot data lives on disk.

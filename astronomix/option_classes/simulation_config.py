Static simulation configuration.

Defines :class:`SimulationConfig` — the bundle of options that, unlike the
simulation parameters, necessitate recompilation when changed — together with
the integer-coded enumerations they reference (backends, solver/boundary/Riemann
modes, positivity modes, ...), the small geometry vector helpers, the sub-configs
for gravity and positivity, and the ``finalize_config`` pass that fills in
derived fields and validates the configuration.

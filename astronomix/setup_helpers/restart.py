    Args:
        directory: The checkpoint directory used as ``snapshot_storage_path``.
        params: The simulation parameters of the run to resume. Returned with
            ``t_start`` set to the checkpoint's time so the integration picks up
            where it left off.
        step: The checkpoint step to restore. ``None`` (default) restores the
            latest one.
        sharding: Optional target sharding for the restored state / forcing /
            N-body state (e.g. when resuming on a different device topology).
            When ``None`` the sharding stored in the checkpoint is recovered.

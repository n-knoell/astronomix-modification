"""Orbax-backed disk storage for the time-integration loop carry.

Used by the ``snapshot_storage_mode == TO_DISK`` path of the time integration
(see :func:`astronomix.time_stepping.time_integration.time_integration`) and by
the restart helper in :mod:`astronomix.setup_helpers`.

Each on-disk checkpoint stores the loop carry threaded through the integrator
— the (unpadded) primitive state, the PRNG key, the persistent OU forcing
field (when active) and the N-body state (when active) — plus the current
simulation time and iteration count. This mirrors
:class:`~astronomix.time_stepping.time_integration.LoopState`, so a checkpoint
is everything needed to resume a run bit-reproducibly.

Implementation notes
--------------------
We use Orbax's **synchronous** ``StandardCheckpointer`` and lay out one
numbered sub-directory per step (``<root>/<step>``). Synchronous saving is a
deliberate choice: the asynchronous path coordinates step-directory creation
through a background signalling barrier that deadlocks in a single-process,
multi-device setting. The synchronous checkpointer writes one sharded array per
device directly (scaling to multiple devices / nodes) and, crucially, restores
straight into a sharded target without the async machinery.

The PRNG key is stored as raw key data (``jax.random.key_data`` -> a plain
uint32 array tensorstore can serialise) and rebuilt with
``jax.random.wrap_key_data`` on load. The OU forcing field is only written when
present; its absence on load is reported as ``forcing = None``.
